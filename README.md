   The Print Statement does not require double quotes.
   It has fetures like [username] and /n. `\n` Will not work. Inside, Use `/n`.
   To include the users name please use the `[username]` statement inside of the script. You can find examples. In the example folder
   If you are wanting the users age please use the `{ageScanner}` statement inside of the script.
